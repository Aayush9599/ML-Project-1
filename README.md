# ML-Project-1
**Summary**
Followed a standard data science and machine learning workflow to preprocess data, build and evaluate models, and ultimately make predictions. 

**Steps involved :**

**1.Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned and prepared the Instagram Users Datetime Posts dataset, which is a crucial step to ensure the data is in the right format for analysis.

**2.Machine Learning Pipeline:**
Splitted the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, which is essential for evaluating model performance.

Used the Pipeline class to streamline the modeling process and ensure consistent preprocessing and modeling steps.

Applied cross-validation to evaluate the linear regression model and Robust regression model to assess model performance.

**3.Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the model's performance by finding the best combination of hyperparameters.

**4.Final Model Building:**
Selected the best model based on the results of the hyperparameter tuning, and built and fitted the final model using the training data.

**5.Prediction and Evaluation:**
Made predictions on the number of likes for the test data using the final model.
Computed the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well model's predictions align with the actual data.
